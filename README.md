Squawk
======
A simple peer to peer morse code based chat program. 
----------------------------------------------------
*Built for RaspberryPi and PiFaceDigitalIO boards*

###Course:
CSCI 333C Networking (Taken as an independent course)  
Professor John Broere  
Principia College  
Spring 2015  

###NOTE:
There is some baggage left over in this repo from the prototype phase of the project where sockets were used for implementation. The files to focus on are: Morse.py, Main.py, and IO_Delegate.py. All others are just along for the ride and not *enterprise level* documented.

###Purpose:
Has your time machine malfunctioned and you are stuck in 1872 without a way to communicate? Do you have a Raspberry Pi or two laying around? Squawk can be the solution you are looking for! Squawk is a Python 3 peer to peer morse code encoded chat client. With Squawk, a RaspberryPi Model B, and a PiFaceDigitalIO board you could conceivably have a computerized telegraph system to communicate to your hearts desire. Or just a simple and fun way to communicate with friends.

###Features:
- Cool command-line-interface with full color!
- Instant visualization of translated morse in console
- Variable count length
